# CensorshipFreeInstagram
in the name
Allows users to create censorship resistant posts on the ethereum blockchain. These cannot be removed unless the entire blockchain is shut down. Instead of storing images on ethereum 
it is instead stored on https://ipfs.io/#how a decentralized image storing system in which the hashes obtained are then used for the website. Theres is also an option to tip the native currency of ethereum to the creator of posts.
